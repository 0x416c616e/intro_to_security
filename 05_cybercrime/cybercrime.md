# Cybercrime

**Bulletproof hosts** – shady web hosts that will let their customers use their servers for illegal cybercrime activities. They will ignore law enforcement. They are often in countries that don’t have extradition treaties with the United States. Maybe they’ll bribe local law enforcement to turn a blind eye, and ignore requests from foreign law enforcement. However, many eventually get raided and taken down. But many still exist.

Someone might use a shared host because it’s easy to use, or use AWS because it’s powerful and can be billed by the hour. Performance, cost, security, and convenience are common offerings from web hosts. Bulletproof hosts only differentiate themselves based on being okay with their customers doing illegal things (malware, hacking, spam, illegal/rigged gambling, scams, phishing/fake websites, etc). However, they are much more expensive than typical VPS hosts. 

Obviously, bulletproof hosting is bad. It enables criminal activity. But the reason why I’m including this here is to let you know how and why some attacks can happen. You might think that, if an attack comes from a VPS, that law enforcement would step in and stop the malicious customer from the web host. Maybe they’d get banned from their web host and arrested. But in some areas of the world, laws aren’t enforced very well, and so attackers can use bulletproof hosts there in order to conduct attacks and other cybercrime. 

Many bulletproof hosts are in China, Russia, and Eastern European countries, such as Ukraine. These are countries that are less likely to cooperate with the United States. It would not make sense for a bulletproof host to be located in Canada or the UK, for example, because they are more willing to work with US law enforcement. 

If a criminal uses a bulletproof host, and uses a bulletproof VPS in order to conduct criminal activities, law enforcement and media might wrongly think that the criminal is from those countries. But criminals of any country can use bulletproof services, so an American hacker or botnet owner might be misreported as Russian by the news. It would not make sense for an American hacker to use American servers, as it would be easier for them to get caught and arrested. In addition to offshore bulletproof hosts, a hacker will probably also use Tor to hide their IP address, disable JavaScript to reduce the risk of web-based malware or deanonymization, and a Bitcoin address rather than a bank account.

**Dark web** – the dark web consists of websites that are accessible over a special network called Tor, which means The Onion Router. It’s called Tor because it has many layers. It makes it harder to identify someone. It’s kind of like a VPN in the sense that people who use Tor will be able to hide their IP address, but there’s one big addition that is different from VPNs: hidden services, which are dark web servers that are only accessible via Tor and are hard to figure out where they really are. Tor and the dark web are known for crime, whereas VPN providers will cooperate with law enforcement. Some examples of dark web markets are Silk Road and Alpha Bay, both of which have been taken down by law enforcement.

An operating system that is often associated with the dark web is TAILS, which stands for The Amnesiac Incognito Live System. It’s a Linux distro that is designed for being used with Tor, and for leaving no traces behind. TAILS is a “live” Linux distro, meaning it is not a persistent OS. You boot up from a TAILS flash drive, use it, and then shut the computer down, and then nothing will be saved. TAILS can be useful for whistleblowers, but it can also be used by bad people. 

**Tor hidden services** – websites on the dark web. Unlike a regular website, you can’t easily figure out the real IP of the server, as the entire point of Tor is anonymity. Tor hidden services are commonly used for black markets and hacking forums, where people buy and sell hacking tools, exploits, and generally discuss illegal things. 

Let’s say you have an ecommerce website. It’s a website where people can buy and sell things. You store customer data. Then a hacker hacks your site and exfiltrates all the payment information from your database. What do they do with it? Well, they might go to a Tor hidden service forum to sell the data for money. It can be valuable to people who commit fraud, such as identity thieves. 

In cybercrime, there are many roles. Someone might specialize in SQL injection or other security exploits, and then they make money by selling data they steal that way. There will be other criminals who might be less tech-savvy, but they buy credit card information (for relatively cheap) so they can make money by commiting fraud. Some people specialize in escrow services, because buyers and sellers don’t necessarily trust each other. Some people on the dark web are software developers who make money by writing malware and hacking tools instead of legitimate software. It’s true that some tools are free and open source, such as Kali Linux and Metasploit. But some specialty tools, or malware that someone can use to make money (ransomware, RATs, bots and botnets), can sometimes cost money. Some people will even just write very small tools that work with other stuff to make malware. For example, some people specialize in malware tools called crypters and packers, which are tools that make it harder for security software to detect it. 

Just like how a legitimate software developer will use tools and frameworks that other people made, rather than starting from scratch, malware developers are the same way. Why make a crypter from scratch when you can pay someone else?

If a hacker exfiltrates data from a database, they might try to sell it. But if they don’t have much of a reputation on a certain hacker community, people might be skeptical, because there’s no honor among thieves and hackers will scam other criminals. So they might offer a free sample of a few accounts that they exfiltrated, in order to prove that they’re legitimate.

Cybercrime can be very lucrative. It’s a $1.5 trillion industry. But most low-skilled attackers don’t make much at all. There is also a high risk of getting caught. 

I am just including information about malware and hacking so you are aware of how you need to take security seriously. People can make money from hacking you or your website/app. 

**Carding forums** – a web forum, usually on the dark web, where people buy and sell credit card information. 

**Warrant canary** – a warrant canary is a notification from a criminal service provider, such as someone who runs a dark web forum or marketplace, that they have not been raided by law enforcement. If the warrant canary is not updated, it means they’ve been arrested, subpoenaed, raided, etc. It might be updated periodically, or just kept on a site until something bad happens. 

**Bitcoin** – a cryptocurrency commonly used by hackers, malware developers, drug dealers, tax evaders, and other bad people. Typically, dark web deals will be done using Bitcoin (or one of many lesser-known cryptocurrencies, called “altcoins”), and then criminals try to cash out and get something like USD, though it’s easier said than done.

**Bitcoin wallet file** – a file for keeping your Bitcoins. 

**Bitcoin exchange** – a site that will let users exchange Bitcoin or USD and vice versa.

**Wallet service** – instead of managing your own wallet, a service might do it for you.

**Stealing bitcoins** – a lot of hacking and malware involves stealing malware, because unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin doesn’t support chargebacks. So if someone steals all your Bitcoins, there’s not much you can do about it. By contrast, if someone commits fraud using your credit card, you’ll be protected. 

Instead of going after individuals, hackers often go after wallet services/Bitcoin exchanges.

**Altcoin** – an alternative cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is not an altcoin because it's the most well-known and widely-used cryptocurrency.

**Data breaches** – here are some high-profile companies and organizations that have had data breaches: Equifax, Yahoo, OPM, Myspace, Adobe, Dow Jones, JP Morgan, the IRS, Experian, Target, eBay, Uber, the NSA, the CIA, Deloitte, Anthem, The Securities and Exchanges Commission, Facebook, Instagram, Google (Operation Aurora), Mt. Gox, and more.

**Cryptocurrency tumbler** – a service for laundering/anonymizing cryptocurrency. If someone hacks a Bitcoin exchange or uses some other way to steal cryptocurrency, gets Bitcoin from ransomware victims, or buys Bitcoin with USD and then wants it to be harder to track/tie to their real identity, criminals will use a cryptocurrency tumbler service, which costs a little money but can make their cryptocurrency harder to track. A tumbler might also be called a mixer.

**KYC (Know Your Customer or Know Your Client)** – one thing that is difficult for cybercriminals is KYC. If you’re a cybercriminal with a lot of Bitcoin, and you want to exchange it for USD, they will want to know where you got it from. If you declare a lot of income on your taxes, they want to know how you got it. KYC is an important concept for banks, exchanges, and other places that deal with money, because they don’t want to enable criminals or money laundering. 

Contrary to popular belief, not all cybercrime is on the dark web. Some of it is just on bulletproof hosts, which are not the dark web. I guess someone could technically set up a bulletproof VPS as a Tor hidden service, but they don’t have to. The reason why people use Tor hidden services is because they don’t want law enforcement to know about them, but bulletproof hosts just ignore law enforcement, so they don’t have the same kinds of concerns.

Instead of (or in addition to) cryptocurrency, cybercriminals might use prepaid debit cards or even gift cards. I’ve heard of criminals using MoneyPak cards and gift cards for Google Play, Amazon, Walmart, CVS, and Walgreens.

**Corporate espionage and stolen intellectual property** – why invent technology when you can just hack another company and steal their designs?

**Data trading** – buying and selling stolen data, such as exfiltrated database tables.

**Malicious Tor nodes** – Tor consists of servers called nodes. Because Tor is designed to keep users and server owners anonymous, it’s hard to say who owns what. But it’s been reported that some Tor nodes are actually malicious. 

**i2p** – i2p is similar to Tor. It stands for Invisible Internet Project.

**Deep web vs. dark web** – the deep web is just any web page or website that can’t be found on a search engine. That can include stuff with robots.txt, stuff that blocks search engine crawlers, pages that require a login, and so on. The dark web means stuff like Tor, which makes it harder to track down where a user or server is. The deep web is not the same as the dark web.

**Final thoughts on the dark web and shady hosts**

Some people say there are legitimate uses for the dark web. Maybe, maybe not. Maybe there are some government whistleblowers who can benefit from the anonymity. But for the most part, the dark web has a really bad reputation, so my advice is to just avoid it entirely.
